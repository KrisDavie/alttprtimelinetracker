Overview
This document is intended to be an SRAM reference for the randomizer base ROM. The base ROM expands the SRAM size to 32k and removes the last two save files. Credit to MathOnNapkins, the editors of the vanilla ALttP wiki, and the randomizer ROM developers who have documented nearly all of this information elsewhere.

Notes

Offsets on this page start from $7EF000* in WRAM or at 0x00* in an .sram file. The ROM is mapped as LoROM, so the cartridge's SRAM is located at $700000*.
When bytes are laid out as individual bits, this indicates either bit flags or densely packed integers (i.e., smaller than one byte.)
Values bigger than one byte are little-endian (e.g. a 16-bit number that is 0x55* 0xAA* in a hex editor or debugger is actually #$AA55.)
SRAM Map
Room Data: 0x000* to 0x24F*
There are 296 (0x128\*) rooms in in the ROM. Each room's data occupies one word, or two bytes.

High Byte
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
d d d d b k c/k c/r
Low Byte
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
c c c c q q q q

d - door opened (either unlocked, bombed or other means)
b - boss battle won
k - key or item (such as a 300 rupee gift)
c - chest, big key chest, or big key lock. Any combination of them totaling to 6 is valid.
r - special rupee tiles, whether they've been obtained or not.
q - quadrants visited:
The quadrant bits corresponds to quadrants 4, 3, 2, and 1 in that order which is also how the quadrants are laid out on a tile from left to right (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right), so if quadrants 4 and 1 have been "seen" by Link, then qqqq will look like 1001.

Unused: 0x250* to 0x27F*
Presumed unused in both vanilla and randomizer.
Overworld Event Information: 0x280* to 0x2FF*
Each area occupies one byte.

? h o ? ? ? s ?

o - If set, the area will draw its designated overlay when you enter it. e.g. If you're triggered misery mire then the entrance shows up there the next time you enter that area. You can view overlays in the latest release of Hyrule Magic. Other overlays include stairs leading underground, and the removal of the weather vane after it has exploded.
s - If set, the area will draw its secondary overlay when you enter it.
h - If set, free-standing item has been collected in this area already. Also used for a handful of other sprites.
? - Unknown, possibly unused.
Shop Purchase Counts: 0x302* to 0x33F*
The randomizer ROM uses new shop code to handle loading and configuration of shops which allows the higher-level item and entrance randomizers to use easy abstractions for changing them. The higher-level randomizers can dictate a certain number of times that a shop item can be re-purchased (e.g. you can only buy capacity upgrades seven times.) The bytes here are used to count how many times a single item in a shop has been purchased. They are dynamically assigned at generation time, which is to say that any single byte should not be considered statically bound to a certain item in a specific shop. Take-Any caves as well as the old man with the sword in Retro world state are considered shops in this context.

Note 1: This is noted as a "temporary home" for the shop purchase counts in the base rom's source code
Note 2: Jumping into deep water without flippers and being placed back on land on the Hobo and Zora's Domain maps are known to overwrite 0x302* and 0x304* respectively. This has no effect if a shop item whose purchase count is located at these addresses can always be repurchased, but will lead to unintended behavior if the item can only be purchased a limited amount of times.

Presumed unused.
Player's Name (first four characters): 0x3D9* to 0x3E0*

The randomizer base ROM does not use the 2nd and 3rd save files, so the player can use all 12 characters for their name. The first four are here. The remaining characters can be found in two locations: immediately after the following validity value and at 0x500* - 0x50F*
Note each of the six letters is represented by a 16-bit number.

When you beat the game, the number of times you died gets recorded here.

Magic used.
Unknown: 0x46E* - 0x4DF*

Presumed unused.
Chest Key Counters: 0x4E0* - 0x4ED*

Each dungeon has one byte in this block of memory that counts how many chest keys have been collected. As in the current key counts, Hyrule Castle and Sewers keys are counted together. Also note that currently the randomizer ROM will never increment the counter for Eastern Palace unless a chest key is manually placed.

Hyrule Castle: 0x4E0*
Sewers: 0x4E1*
Eastern Palace: 0x4E2*
Desert Palace: 0x4E3*
Agahnim's Tower: 0x4E4*
Swamp Palace: 0x4E5*
Palace of Darkness: 0x4E6*

Tower of Hera: 0x4EA*

Unknown: 0x4EF* - 0x4FD*

Presumed unused except for a rando-specific File Marker at 0x4F0*, which will be 0xFF* on an active save file and 0x00* on a fresh file.
Checksum: 0x4FE* - 0x4FF*
Inverse Checksum: 0x4FE* to 0x4FF\*

The SRAM save loading routine relies upon an "inverse" checksum. Changes to any byte in the SRAM between 0x00* and 0x4FE* must be added or subtracted to this checksum or the save file will be deleted. The checksum can be computed by adding every word between the beginning of the file and 0x4FE* (exclusively) and subtracting the sum from 0x5A5A*, using overflowing arithmetic for both operations.

Player's Name (characters 5-12): 0x500* to 0x50F*

See Appendix 1[Appendix 1 3]
Unused: 0x510* - 0x1FFF*
This space previously contained a second and third save file with the same layout as above. Currently unused.
